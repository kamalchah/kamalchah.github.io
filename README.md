# Personal Website https://kamalchah.github.io/

I made this website during the Carleton University Web Dev hackathon that ran from October 3rd 2020 to October 4th 2020.

This website is a simple one page resume website I learned to make during the hackathons that makes use of a ton of CSS and a little bit of javascript. I find it pretty cool, there's some nice colors along with some pretty nice animations.
The website contains 5 sections, an About Me, Projects, Courses taken, Interests and Work Experience.
