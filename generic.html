							<p>Hello, I am currently studying Computer Science at Carleton University as a secon year CO-OP student. I started out my first year (started sept. 2019) as a software engineer and had a very rough start. The results were 2 dropped courses, an F, a C and a C-. I perservered through and managed to pick it up the following semster and summer and am now back on the right path. My interests include web developement, software engineering, data science, machine learning and AI as things I would like to grow and expand on. I have beginner experience in web development and none in all the other fields.
							</p>

							<p>
							My father immigrated here from Lebanon in ~1998 with my mother and I was born in Ottawa, Ontario in 2001. I attended Louis-Riel for my high-school education from 2013 to 2019, graduated top of the class with honours and a yellow excellence ribbon.
