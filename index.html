							<h1>About me</h1>
							<p>Hello, I am currently studying Computer Science at Carleton University as a third year CO-OP student. I started out my first year in September of 2019 as a software engineer and have since switch to Computer Science and enjoyed every second of it. I completed my first Internship in the Fall of 2021 as a Software Engineering Intern at the University of Ottawa in the Department of Medicine. I worked on a Virtual Reality Escape Room to be used by students of the department and worked closely with PropelVR as well as my co-workers to produce a 10 puzzle virtual experience to students.

							<div class="interests">
								<p>Since starting my degree, I have loved every second of code that I have been in contact with. It's become one of my favorite hobbies
									recently along with just learning new technologies. I also really like playing video games like CS:GO and Rocket League on my free time.

							Before attending Carleton University, I played alot of soccer in high school. It is one of my passions that I enjoy every time I step on the
							field. To the right is a photo of me and some teammates celebrating getting 3rd place at OFSAA (Provincial tournament for all high schools in ontario) in 2019, I was the goalkeeper. (I'm in yellow)
